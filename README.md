# Key Cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin (2020-2024)  

*Project Overview*  

This project analyzes the price trends, correlations, and patterns of three major cryptocurrencies‚ÄîBitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Coin‚Äîfrom 2020 to 2024. Key aspects include examining price volatility, identifying trends, exploring seasonality and monthly patterns, and forecasting future prices. The study also investigates the interdependence of these cryptocurrencies and their stability during significant economic events. The insights provided aim to enhance understanding of the dynamics and relationships in the cryptocurrency market.

#### Key Findings üî¨  

** Price Volatility Across Cryptocurrencies:**  
-Bitcoin exhibits significantly higher volatility compared to Ethereum and Binance Coin, making it more appealing for short-term trading strategies.  
-Ethereum's lower variance reflects its widespread adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts, indicating it may be less speculative than Bitcoin.  
-Binance Coin's relative stability positions it as a "safer" option for diversification, appealing to risk-averse investors.  
-The halving event (Bitcoin Halving on May 11, 2020) impacted all three cryptocurrencies, influencing their volatility to varying degrees.  
-Roles: Bitcoin as a speculative "store of value," Ethereum as a utility-focused blockchain, and Binance Coin as an ecosystem token.  

** Correlation Between Cryptocurrencies:**  
-Ethereum and Binance Coin have an exceptionally high positive correlation (0.918), reflecting a close relationship in their market movements.  
-Bitcoin's price movements strongly influence both Ethereum and Binance Coin, highlighting Bitcoin's anchoring role in the cryptocurrency market.  
-Shared involvement in DeFi and overlapping user bases contribute to the high correlation between Ethereum and Binance Coin.  

** Trend Analysis:**  
-Bitcoin's price shows the fastest upward trend, increasing by approximately $24.93 per day on average.  
-Ethereum's prices rise moderately, with an average daily increase of $1.22.  
-Binance Coin exhibits the slowest growth, with an average daily increase of $0.25.  
-Bitcoin's steep growth trajectory underscores its dominant position and increasing valuation in the market.  

** Comparing Average Prices:**  
-Bitcoin has the highest average price ($36,304.24) and a significantly wider price range than Ethereum ($1,981.85) and Binance Coin ($306.70).  
-Ethereum's average price reflects moderate variability, while Binance Coin demonstrates the smallest price range among the three.  

** Seasonality and Monthly Patterns, Forecasting:**  
-All three cryptocurrencies exhibit a long-term upward trend over the next year, as forecasted by the Prophet model.  
-Seasonal patterns and periodic dips suggest market behavior influenced by recurring factors such as market cycles or investor sentiment.  
-Forecasts for early 2026:  
Bitcoin: $150,000‚Äì$160,000  
Ethereum: $5,000‚Äì$6,000  
Binance Coin: $1,200‚Äì$1,400  
-Forecasts indicate significant growth potential but remain subject to real-world market conditions.  

** The impact of cryptocurrencies on each other:**  
-Bitcoin exerts the most influence, driving price movements in both Ethereum and Binance Coin.  
-Ethereum impacts Bitcoin and Binance Coin at higher lags, indicating delayed market responses.  
-Binance Coin reacts to Bitcoin and Ethereum but does not significantly predict their prices.  
-Lagged relationships suggest market psychology and external factors influence delayed responses, particularly for Binance Coin.  

** Price Stability During Economic Events:**   
-Major global events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, significantly increased volatility across all three cryptocurrencies.  
-Economic uncertainty during such events drives market fluctuations due to shifts in investor sentiment and risk perception.
